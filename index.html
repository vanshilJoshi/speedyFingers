      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">How to Improve Your Typing Speed</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Take a deep breath, relax your fingers, and take it slow. You need to be focused and not annoyed when attempting the typing speed test. The best thing you can do to start typing faster is to type more. The more practice you get under your belt, the faster your ‘typing-fu’ will be. It’s all about developing muscle memory. Just make sure you are reinforcing good habits and not ones that will leave your fingers hurting after an intense typing session.

      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">Word per Minute (WPM) Typing Test</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          What is the WPM typing test? There are different types of tests for typing. This one is a typing test that expresses your typing skills in words per minute. The more you practice typing, and the more you test your typing speed, the higher your WPM score will be. Some online typing tests and typing test games focus only on WPM typing. The disadvantage of the WPM typing test is that you are only learning how to type fast. WPM typing tests do not show your accuracy.        </p>

      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">Why Is Typing Speed Important to Everyone?</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The faster you type, the faster you will be able to communicate with others. You will be able to save a ton of time on any kind of work that requires typing. At first, it will be a couple of extra minutes that you won’t really notice. Over time, the minutes will turn into hours of saved time that you can spend on other activities.        </p>

    <div class="faq">
      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">What Is the Average Typing Speed?</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The average person types between 38 and 40 words per minute (WPM). That translates into between 190 and 200 characters per minute (CPM). However, professional typists type a lot faster, averaging between 65 and 75 WPM.        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">What Is CPM and How Can You Calculate It?</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The CPM stands for the number of characters you type per minute, including all the mistakes. “Corrected” scores count only correctly typed words. WPM is just the corrected CPM divided by five. This is the de facto international standard.      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">How Many Words per Minute Is a Good Score?</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          An average professional typist usually types around 65 to 75 WPM. More advanced positions require 80 to 95 (this is typically the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs). There are also some advanced typists whose work requires speeds above 120 WPM.      </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h4 class="faq-subHeading">What Is the Best 10-Finger Typing Layout?</h4>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Of course, you should use ten fingers for typing, but you can start with a layout that’s the most comfortable for you. The small bumps on the F and J keys will help your fingers locate the correct position without looking. This setup should give you a full range of motion. The more you type, the faster you will get. There are a few alternative layouts that propose a more ergonomic approach to typing.      </div>
